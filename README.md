This is v1 of my first personal website! Check it out live [here](https://misterharsh.github.io).

I've been wanting to get into blogging for quite some time now and I finally decided to get my butt off the couch and try to figure out how to put a basic site together. I definitely plan to learn some web development and revamp the site as I go, or even make another one from scratch. For now, this will do though.

The website has been created using the Halve Jekyll Theme as a template. The original can be found at Taylan Tatli's github. Check out the repository [here](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Halve).

To learn how to install and use this theme for your own use, check out the [installation guide](https://taylantatli.github.io/Halve/halve-theme/) for more information. As mentioned in the original repository, this project is under MIT license.

Lastly, if you have a question, find a bug, or just want to say hi, please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/misterharsh/misterharsh.github.io/issues/new).
