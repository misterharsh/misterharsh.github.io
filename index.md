Hi! I'm Harsh Modhera. 

I'm a 21 year old studying computer engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'll be graduating in May 2018! 

You see that cabin in the image? When I get older, I want to explore the mountains and live in a home like that for a while. It'll be my great escape.
